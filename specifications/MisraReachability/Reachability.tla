---------------------------- MODULE Reachability ----------------------------
(***************************************************************************)
(* This module defines reachability in a directed graph.  A directed graph *)
(* is a collection of nodes and directed edges between nodes.  The set of  *)
(* nodes reachable from a node n consists of n and all nodes that can be   *)
(* reached from n by following edges in the direction the edges point.     *)
(* The first thing we must do is decide how to represent a directed graph  *)
(* mathematically.  There are two simple ways to do it.  The most obvious  *)
(* way is by a set Nodes of nodes and a set Edges of edges, where an edge  *)
(* pointing from node n to node m is represented by the pair <<n, m>>.  We *)
(* could do this by declaring Nodes and Edges to be constants and adding   *)
(* the assumption                                                          *)
(*                                                                         *)
(*    ASSUME Edges \subseteq Nodes \X Nodes                                *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* The second way is by a set Nodes of nodes and a function Succ such that *)
(* Succ[n] is the set of nodes pointed to by edges from n.  These two ways *)
(* of representing directed graphs are obviously equivalent.  Starting     *)
(* with Nodes and Edges, we can define Succ by                             *)
(*                                                                         *)
(*    Succ[n \in Nodes] ==                                                 *)
(*       LET EdgesFromN == {e \in Edges : e[1] = n}                        *)
(*       IN  {e[2] : e \in EdgesFromN}                                     *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* Conversely, given Nodes and Succ, we can define Edges by                *)
(*                                                                         *)
(*    Edges == UNION {Succ[n] : n \in Nodes}                               *)
(*                                                                         *)
